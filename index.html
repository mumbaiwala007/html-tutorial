    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
      This is my first ever HTML project that I am hosting on the Internet via
      Git.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>What have I learnd so far in HTML?</h2>
    <p>
      HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is used to create web
      pages.
    </p>
    <br />
    HTML uses what are called "tags" or "HTML elements" to render web pages.
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Header and paragraph elements (contain text contents)</li>
      <li>Void elements (no content) new lines and horizontal rule</li>
      <li>Image and anchor (hyper link) elements</li>
      <li>Ordered and unordered lists</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>Basic tags</h2>
    <h3>The header tags</h3>
    <p>
      There are six header tags starting from h1 to h6. There should be only one
      h1 in a document which is equivalent to title of a book for example. This
      is also important from accessability point of view for the folks who use
      screen readers. See examples below: <br />
      <h1>This is header 1 and is repeated in this web page, sorry!</h1>
      <h2>This is header 2.</h2>
      <h3>This is header 3.</h3>
      <h4>This is header 4.</h4>
      <h5>This is header 5.</h5>
      <h6>This is header 6.</h6>
      <h7>This is header 7.</h7> <== There is no such thing and this is rendered as "normal text". <br /> <br />
      This is how a typical header tag looks: <br />
      &lt;h1&gt;Your text&lt;/h1&gt; <br />
      &lt;h2&gt;Your text for an h2 tag&lt;/h2&gt; <br />
      &lt;h3&gt;Your text rendered as an h3 tag&lt;/h3&gt; <br />
      And so on...

    </p>

    <h2>The paragraph tag</h2>
    <p>So, the paragraph tag is your typical text content, a paragraph for example. This text is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This text is another paragraph.</p>
    <p>And this is the third paragraph. As you can see, they all start on a new line with some space before the previous paragraph. You can add as many paragraphs as you would like.</p>
    <p>This is how you write a paragraph tag: &lt;p&gt;Your text goes here...&lt;/p&gt;</p>
